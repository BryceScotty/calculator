# Calculator

I introduce to you the calulator 3000

Features:

- Basic operations such as multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition

- Percentages

- Proportional percentages (so 1 - 50% is 0.5 but 5 * 20% is 1)

- Exponents (powers) that can be NESTED

- Lets the user know if the answer contains an imaginary number

- Parenthesis that can be NESTED anywhere and all the operators work in seamless unison

- Automatically inputs a multiplication symbol if a digit is entered after a percent of right parenthesis

- Negative button that sets decimals, integers, exponents, percents and whole parentheses sets to negative

- Dark and light modes

- Screen that holds up to 4 previous problems and their respective solutions

- Safety boundaries (impossible for user to enter a sequence of characters that would cause a syntax error)

- Impossible to get NaN as an answer but if large can get exponential notation as a result

- Delete and clear buttons

- No JS rounding issues with decimals

- Configure up to 12 floating digits

- Keyboard support

Designed to mimic the google calculator so answers should be the same, if not maybe even a bit more precise

To crosscheck the answer with google, simply copy the problem from the screen into the URL 
(if you do  this, you might have to substitute the alone percent symbols with .01)

Some inconsistencies with code format and methods since this was an experimental project so readability suffered

Some problems to try:

- 52 - -45453.%^% x 53 x (12 / 54 x (2^-60% x 8 / 5 x (225% x 155 - 6)^2 + 6 x (2 - 9 / 3 x 3 x (3^.6 - 2) / 6) x 6)) - 2

- (2%)^-3 - -2 x .01 x -(40 - 35% x (2 / -0.1 / -(2 x (3^-(7. + 12%))^2)))

- 2 x (3 - 1 x (-.01 x 2^-2 / 3 x (.8 + 59%)))

- (1) x -%^3 x (3 / 3 x (2 - 6 x -(2% x -1) + 3^1^2 / -9))^2

- .03^5

- .10001 x .100010001
